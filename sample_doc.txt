Low-Level vs. High-Level
Computer programmers split coding languages into two groups: low-level and high-level.

Low-level languages, like binary, are considered "machine-oriented." Machine-oriented languages write instructions that must be specified in terms of the capabilities of the processor in question. Coders also refer to low-level languages as assembly language or machine code.

High-level languages are user-oriented. Most of the popular coding languages, such as Python, fall under this category. Programmers designed high-level languages to convert an algorithm into program code more easily. High-level coding languages are closer to human language — they include more nuance and adaptability than low-level coding languages.

Coding vs. Programming
A lot of people think coding and programming are the same thing. Coding, however, is only one small part of programming.

Coding is the process of allowing humans to speak to computers. As computers only understand binary language — a series of zeros and ones — humans need to use a programming language as a translator of sorts.

Programming, on the other hand, includes not only coding but also the digital product's planning, testing, deployment, and maintenance.
